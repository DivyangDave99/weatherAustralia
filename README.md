There are total 22 features available in the dataset and target variable is "RainTomorrow".

In this notebook you will find:
- ML models running on original dataset, 
- How to perform UnderSampling, OverSampling on data, 
- How to apply feature extraction on data, 
- And at last, All results are compared and depending upon accuracyScore, F1Score, Precision and Recall Random Forest outperforms all other models.
